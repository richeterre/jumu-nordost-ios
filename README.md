Jumu Nordost for iOS
====================

More info will follow when it's showtime.

Setup
-----

The project doesn't compile until you have provided a credentials file. Do as follows:

1. Open the file `JumuNordost/Resources/Credentials.plist.example` in your favorite text editor.
1. Fill in the API key as indicated by the placeholder.
1. Important: Save the file __under a new name__: `Credentials.plist`. This filename is ignored by Git to prevent you from checking secrets into version control.
1. Keep the `.example` file around for future reference.
1. The project should now compile :)
